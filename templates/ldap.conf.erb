# FILE MANAGED BY PUPPET. ALL MANUAL CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN.

# We do not want to break your existing configuration, hence:
#   URI, BASE and TLS_CACERT have been added if they were not set.
#   In case any of them were set, a comment with trailing note
#   "# modified by IPA" note has been inserted.
# To use IPA server with openLDAP tools, please comment out your
# existing configuration for these options and uncomment the
# corresponding lines generated by IPA.
